# I created a Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a part of my project. I used HTML to structure the quiz by displaying the questions, options, buttons, and score section. With CSS, I added the design part like colors, fonts, and layout to make it look more attractive. The most important part is handled by JavaScript, which controls the logic of the quiz. It loads the questions one by one, checks the answers, calculates the score, and shows the results. This made the project interactive instead of just being a static webpage. I used Visual Studio Code as the editor because it is easy to use, supports extensions, and makes debugging simpler. This type of quiz application can be used in many real-world situations. For example, in the education field, teachers can use it to create online quizzes for students. It can also be used in training programs by companies to test the knowledge of employees after workshops or sessions. Apart from learning, it can be applied in entertainment as trivia games, competitions, or even in surveys to collect responses. With a few changes, it can also become part of bigger systems like e-learning platforms or learning management systems.Working on this project gave me good practice with DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic building in JavaScript. It also improved my understanding of how design and functionality come together in web development. I realized that even a small project like this can teach a lot about creating user-friendly applications. If needed, the application can be extended further by adding features like a timer for each question, random question banks, progress indicators, or a leaderboard for multiple players.#
